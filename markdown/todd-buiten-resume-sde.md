Work Summary
------------

I have extensive skills as a Software Developer and Architect, primarily working on large scale global web sites with millions of users and billions of transactions per day. My secondary focus is on IoT at both the hardware and data collection tiers. As a developer skilled in both frontend and backend technologies, I am up-to-date in many modern technologies such as React, HTML5, and CSS3 (frontend) and Node.js, Python, REST APIs, Docker, and Kubernetes (backend). I love designing and building complex software as well as helping my colleagues learn new technologies and processes.

I have worked for a wide range of companies from small mom-and-pops to large multinationals (Microsoft, Starbucks, T-Mobile, GoDaddy). I specialize in web technology, global geo-distribution, and IoT.
